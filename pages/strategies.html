              <h2>Tic Tac Toe Basics</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Tic Tac Toe is a game that is played on a grid of 9 squares</li>
                <li>To start, each player is assigned a symbol (x or o)
                <li>Players alternate choosing where to place their symbol on the board</li>
                <li>The game is won when one player gets 3 in a row</li>
                <li>Players can win using columns, rows, or the diagonals</li>

              </ul>

              <h2>Pro Strategies</h2>

              <h4>Intro</h4>
              <p>While tic tac toe often ends in a draw, there are some powerful strategies that can help you to win.</p>
              <h4>Going First</h4>
              <p>When going first, there are some options that are better than others</p>
              <p>While the center is tempting, your best move will actually be to start in the corner</p>
              <p>If you start in the corner you can guarantee a win as long as your opponent's first move isn't the center</p>
              <p>To guarantee the win, your next move needs to take a corner that leaves an open space between your two spots.
                This will force your opponent to block your win</p>
              <p>You then place your next symbol in the final corner if their first move was in a corner. If not, you place your next move in the center.
                These moves will give you two possible winning moves on your next turn and make it impossible for your opponent to block both.
                <p>That's how to win tic-tac-toe when you go first!</p>
